My goal is to use these github pages for articles aimed at technical audience and use my main website for general public. There are two reasons for me to choose github pages/quarto combo over my wordpress website:\n\nI found it hard to get syntax highlight support for Julia language. Most of my computational work are done in Julia.\nI want these notes to be eternally accessible."

One of the reasons I moved from Franklin to Quarto was Quartoâ€™s language-agnostic approach and advanced layout setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 7, 2022\n\n\nAthul Sudheesh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
